**I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at the [University of Leeds](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/computing).** My general research interests are machine learning, computer vision and bio-inspired computing applied to medical imaging. Specifically, I use deep learning and computer vision algorithms to support the pathology workflow through domain-aware analysis of whole slide digital histopathology images. Some side interests are back-end application development and algorithms.

My supervisors are [Andy Bulpitt](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9S9v3bcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [David Hogg](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5VJ4YPQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in collaboration with [Darren Treanor](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tTwpjE0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

For the 2017-2019 academic years, I am assisting the following undergraduate modules:

+ COMP1711 Procedural Programming (C)
+ COMP2011 Web Application Development (Python with Flask)
+ COMP1921 Programming Project (C and Java)

I am an author for [RealPython](https://realpython.com/), and a certified Software Carpentries instructor for workshops on subjects including Python programming for data science, machine learning and computer vision.

I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ysbecca/) for general professional / networking contact, occasionally on [GitHub](https://github.com/ysbecca) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ysbecca) although most of my work there is in private repositories (sorry, I'm working on changing that), and an extremely sporadic contributor on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1677813/ysbecca).

The best way to reach me directly is via email at *ysbecca at gmail dot com* or *r.s.stone at leeds.ac.uk*. For academic contact, please see my [Faculty of Engineering profile](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/pgr/513/Rebecca_Stone).
