**I am a post-graduate student in computer science at the [University of Leeds](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/computing).** My research interests are machine learning, computer vision and bio-inspired computing applied to the medical field. Some side interests are back-end web development and algorithms. 

**I also enjoy cooking.** On multiple occasions I've wanted to try a cooking blog or a programming blog, where I could post my meal ideas and programming side projects. This blog is what happened.

**I would love to hear from you**, provided that itâ€™s not spam.

I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ysbecca/) for general professional / networking contact, occasionally on [GitHub](https://github.com/ysbecca) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ysbecca) although most of my work there is in private repositories (sorry), and a very sporadic contributor on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1677813/ysbecca).

The best way to reach me directly is via email at *ysbecca at gmail dot com*.
