This blog is my attempt to write about some of my thoughts and experiences as a post-graduate student in computer science at the [University of Leeds](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/computing). My research interests are machine learning, computer vision and bio-inspired computing applied to the medical field. I also like web development, algorithms, and riddle solving.

This is my first and only attempt at a blog. I prefer in-person relationships with people over any other kind of relationship. However, I do enjoy reading other blogs, particularly those related to cooking, academics, computer science, and fun games to play with children.

**I would love to hear from you**, provided that itâ€™s not spam.

I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ysbecca/) for general professional / networking contact, occasionally on [GitHub](https://github.com/ysbecca) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ysbecca) although most of my work there is in private repositories (sorry), and a very sporadic contributor on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1677813/ysbecca).

The best way to reach me directly is via email at *ysbecca at gmail dot com*.
