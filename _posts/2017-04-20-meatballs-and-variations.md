<!--excerpt-->

There are so many options with minced meat. I like to prepare the meat by mixing it with vegetables and spices, and then make different variations with it. Vegetables add moisture to the meatballs, egg makes everything stick together, and adding some kind of starch helps soak up flavour and helps the texture.

* minced turkey (500 g)
* 1 finely chopped onion
* 2 chopped garlic heads
* 1 large grated carrot
* finely chopped rocket lettuce (I just had a handful left in the fridge) 
* chopped red chili peppers
* a handful white flour
* 1-2 eggs
* salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, curry powder, white pepper
* 2 spoons flax flour (I have a bag I'm trying to use up)

Using my disposable latex food gloves, I thoroughly mixed these all together. The mixture can be stored short-term in the fridge in an airtight plastic bag or in a bowl with cling film covering the top and pressed against the meat to reduce air exposure. 

**Meatballs**

The first easy meal is meatballs. I served them on their own with a spoon of crème fraîche and a squeeze of lemon juice.

**Cabbage wraps**

I had two large sweetheart cabbages which needed using up, so the next day I made wraps. Sweetheart cabbage is a beautiful, bright green colour and has a slightly sweet and bitter flavour. The bitterness can be cooked away, as well as offset by a strong-flavoured complement such as a meat or garlic. The cabbage leaves are also very appealing to small insects, so a thorough wash is always wise. 

Spoon the minced meat mixture along the centre of the cabbage leaves, wrap them up and tie them with some string (or place them in the steamer snugly to keep them from opening), then steam for about 10-15 minutes. For extra flavour, these can also be baked instead with tomato sauce and toppings.
