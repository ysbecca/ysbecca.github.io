<!--excerpt-->

In my undergraduate years, my roommates and I brought home a food processor we'd found on sale, and made such good use of it that its lifespan was sadly very short. While it still lived, I used it many times to make homemade houmous. I no longer have a food processor, so the best I can do is to buy plain houmous from the store, and doctor it up. This version has a strong garlicky, lemony flavour and has refreshing bits of finely chopped red onions, coriander, with a lovely, spicy pool of chili oil on top.

You can buy storebought chili oil, but if you want a fresh flavour, it's also easy to make. Two long chilis (pictured above) made enough oil for my bowl of houmous which makes approximately 7 large servings. First, wash and chop the chilis into smaller pieces. This lets the flavour out better than leaving them whole.

Drizzle olive oil into a pan. The amount depends on how much and how strong you would like your chili oil. I put approximately three tablespoons, keeping in mind that some oil would be lost in the process.

Keeping the oil lightly sizzling but not too hot (so as not to overheat the olive oil), add the chopped chilis and keep moving them in the pan so they do not burn. Eventually, without becoming charcoaled, they will turn crispy. This takes only a few minutes.

Using a fork or spoon, fish out the chili pieces from the oil and let the oil cool. Now you can prepare the houmous:

* plain houmous (400 g)
* one whole lemon
* 3 large cloves of garlic
* handful of coriander
* half of one small red onion (not pictured)
* fine black pepper

Mix together a few pinches of black pepper, the houmous, lemon juice, finely chopped garlic cloves and half red onion. I usually mix in the chopped coriander as well, leaving a little for the topping. Pour in the chili oil on top.

This goes lovely with pita bread, normal toast, or fluffy garlic naan bread. Enjoy!
