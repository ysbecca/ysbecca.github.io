<!--excerpt-->

My laptop was busy running 6000 images through 250 epochs of a test ConvNet I wrote using Keras and TensorFlow, so I wanted to monitor it and make sure it didn't overheat. I usually stick it by the window so the cold outside air can help the fans out. The window with the best ledge is in the kitchen. Being forced to spend time in the kitchen is always a good thing! As I had a bit of time and a nice bag of chicken breasts, I decided to batter them.

First, cut the chicken into strips and marinate them with Greek yogurt, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Let them sit. Longer is usually better.

I rarely have any panko or breadcrumbs, but I do often have coarse seminola flour, so I found [this recipe](http://www.mygreekdish.com/recipe/chicken-fingers-amazing-yogurt-crust/) for inspiration for a seminola/flour based batter.

* Greek yogurt
* 2 eggs
* 2:1 ratio of seminola to flour
* small spoon of baking powder
* sesame seeds
* lots of paprika
* mixed herbs
* garlic powder
* cayenne pepper and normal black pepper
* salt

Mix the wet and dry things separately, then combine them all together. Add some water as needed to make it less sticky and more batter-y. Then dip the chicken into plain flour for a light coat to help the batter stick, then into the batter, then onto the hot oiled pan. I only used a light drizzle of oil since I don't like deep-frying (I imagine you could, though).

While the chicken is cooking, you can make a quick [Tzatziki](http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/how-to-make-tzatziki/)-like sauce to moisten up the salad and add a cool contrast to the spice of the chicken. My version is very fast, and with bigger cubes of cucumber.

* a few spoons of Greek yogurt
* one spoon of mayo
* one spoon of whole-grained mustard
* juice from half a lemon
* pinch of paprika
* dash of coarse ground pepper
* finely chopped cucumber (about two handfuls - I like cucumber)

That's it! Served on a generous bed of salad greens, sliced cucumber, and tomatos, or however you like.
