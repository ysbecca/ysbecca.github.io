<!--excerpt-->

Time for a fast, warm meal that will taste good the next day, and the next. This chili has plenty of veg, and it all goes into one large pot. 

* minced turkey
* 2 large zucchini, cubed
* small diced onion
* 1 tin beans (pinto or kidney beans are nice, normal baked beans are fine too)
* 2 tins peeled tomatos in sauce (I pull out the tomatos and loosely chop them before adding everything to the mix - if you have tins of chopped tomatoes, it's essentially the same thing)
* 1 tin sweet corn
* spices: salt, pepper, garlic powder, hot curry powder, tumeric, coriander, cayenne, white pepper
* small spoon of corn starch
* diced mushrooms
* finely sliced red chilis (if your spicy tolerance is higher!)

Mix the minced turkey with the spices first, then throw the onions and meat into the pot with a drizzle of oil. If you want an extra spicy kick, put finely chopped red chilis into the oil first and stir around for a few minutes before adding the onions and meat. Once mostly cooked through, add the vegetables, tomatoes and sauce and two cups of water, then cover and let stew.

For toppings, add some finely sliced red onion, sour creme (creme fraiche), dried chives, and the seminola cakes. Freshly chopped coriander would be perfect if you have it as well.

**Homemade seminola cakes**

Seminola cakes are easy and fast. First mix together the dry ingredients then add in the wet, adjusting until you have a wet dough that you can mold with your hands.

* 1 cup coarse seminola flour
* very generous spoonful of sugar
* pinch of salt and pepper
* a couple spoons white flour
* spoontip baking powder
* 1 egg
* 3 spoons of butter (need to melt or soften)
* water as needed

Spoon the dough into your hands, squeeze into a ball, flatten, then cook on the pan with some oil. A few minutes on each side is enough to cook them through.
