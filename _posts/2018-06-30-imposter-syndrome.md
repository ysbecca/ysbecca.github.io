<!--excerpt-->


My first, most vivid memory of experiencing imposter syndrome was at my second internship during undergraduate. I was working three days a week on an operating system which was new to me, with a large project written in a language and framework I had little knowledge of, and surrounded by what appeared to me to be competent, experienced programmers.

It seemed as if I ran into roadblocks every half hour. Each time, I would stubbornly try the few solutions I could think of; when those failed, I spent another half hour on Google and StackOverflow grasping for clues which might point me in the right direction. I knew so little about the domain that I hardly knew what to Google, and even if I did, had difficulty identifying which suggestions were relevant. Finally, an hour (or several hours) later, I pushed my chair back, stood up, and walked ten steps to a coworker, who immediately came over to my screen and speedily identified the problem and outlined a solution. 

_When it was so helpful, why wouldn't I ask for help earlier?_ **I was afraid of being discovered as an imposter.**

Six years later looking back, it is clear to me that while I was a relatively inexperienced programmer, the real issue was that I suffered from imposter syndrome.

> Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which people doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent, often internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". 

The phenomenon was first concretely defined in the paper, ["The imposter phenomenon in high achieving women: dynamics and therapeutic intervention"](http://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf) by clinical psychologists Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes in 1978. Subsequent studies have shown that the syndrome is not gendered; however, generally, men and women tend to handle it differently. 









_"Have you ever considered doing a PhD?"_

I remember the feeling of awe, of surprise, and of disbelief, walking down the corridors of the University just after a meeting with the current Head of School, Professor David Duke. During the first term of my Master's, he taught a fascinating module on parallel and concurrent programming. As the time to choose a topic for the research component of the course approached, I was trying to circumvent the possibility of getting a topic I was not interested in ([which historically equals poor performance](https://ysbecca.github.io/programming/2017/03/18/thoughts-on-getting-good-marks.html)) by speaking to multiple professors about their research and proposing my own research project.

David Duke was an excellent module leader; clearly brilliant, actively engaged in his work, and yet pleasantly approachable with a rather humble demeanor. During the course of our brief discussion mostly about his research, he then asked me why I was doing a Masters, and what I wanted out of it. I fumbled for an answer; truthfully, I was not sure myself. I enjoyed school and learning, and prior work experience had left me still hungry. He then posed the question, "Have you ever considered doing a PhD?" 

The thought had never, not once in my life, ever crossed my mind. I had subconsciously relegated such pursuits to the "exceptionally brilliant and unique" people who were excellent A+'s-only type of students.


I asked my husband several times over the course of the subsequent months, "What if I don't know how to do a PhD?" His response was perfectly reasonable and unsatisfying. "You don't. Nobody knows how to do a PhD until they do it."
