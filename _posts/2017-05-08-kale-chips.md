<!--excerpt-->

It's revision week. In between hours of revising, there are plenty of opportunities to relax and listen to music or other things in the kitchen. These kale chips are (relatively) healthy and tasty; they are crispy and dissolve into garlicky, salty, spicy flakes with only a couple chews. 

In the UK, curly kale is most often sold already pre-cut into small pieces, and rarely in full heads. Unfortunately, this adds a little more time to the process, as the thick kale stalks need to be removed by hand. I usually sift through the kale before putting it into the mixing bowl, tearing off the thick stalk pieces and setting them aside. They take too long to cook and contain too much water to become crispy. If you are fortunate to find a head of kale, you can simply prep the leaves by cutting out the stalks and then loosely tearing the leaves into chip-size pieces. 

* one bag of curly kale ([Tesco sells in bags of 206G](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=252167192) for under a pound; also, the chips shrink so I never make any less than this in one go)
* 2-3 spoons of olive oil (err on too little)
* salt
* garlic powder or granules
* white and black pepper
* optional - cayenne pepper

Place all the kale in a large bowl, and season to taste. You can eat a small raw leaf to test. If you favour spicy, a few dashes of cayenne pepper give a lovely kick.

I typically use disposable plastic cooking gloves to do all the mixing. The key is for every leaf to have a very light coat of oil (too much oil and the chips are overly greasy), so a good way to mix well is to simply toss the leaves and squeeze them in towards each other between tosses. If many leaves look dry and not glossy, you may need a little more oil.

Finally, you want to spread them all out onto baking sheets. They need to be more or less in a single layer, but as they do shrink when cooking, a little overlap is alright. For my bag of 206G, I usually need two large sheets like the one pictured.

Cook at 200 C, checking regularly! **A few minutes is the difference between perfectly crispy and burnt inedible chips.** Your oven intensity may vary so a check after 5 minutes is a good idea. Once the chips have flattened and turn a dark green colour, they are almost done. You'll know they are undercooked if they are limp instead of crispy. The perfect kale chip is mostly dark green, with a tinge of brown-green at the edges and veins (see first photo for reference).

A 206G bag makes about 7 generous handfuls of curly kale chips. Enjoy!
